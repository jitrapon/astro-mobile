# 9.7 stateIn with Eagerly on Lifecycle Scope (FLOW_006)

## Bad Practice

`.stateIn(viewModelScope, SharingStarted.Eagerly, …)` or `lifecycleScope` with `Eagerly`. Upstream runs even with zero collectors.

```kotlin
// BAD: upstream always active — even with zero collectors
val uiState = repo.flow().stateIn(viewModelScope, SharingStarted.Eagerly, Loading)
```

## Recommended

`SharingStarted.WhileSubscribed(5_000)` keeps work active while subscribed plus a short buffer for configuration changes.

```kotlin
// GOOD: stops shortly after last collector unsubscribes
val uiState = repo.flow().stateIn(
    viewModelScope,
    SharingStarted.WhileSubscribed(5_000),
    Loading,
)
```

## Why

`Eagerly` keeps upstream active for the scope lifetime. `WhileSubscribed` matches
Android lifecycle collection patterns and saves battery/network.

## Quick fix

| Erroneous | Optimized |
|-----------|-----------|
| `val uiState = repo.flow().stateIn(viewModelScope, SharingStarted.Eagerly, Loading)` | `val uiState = repo.flow().stateIn(` |
