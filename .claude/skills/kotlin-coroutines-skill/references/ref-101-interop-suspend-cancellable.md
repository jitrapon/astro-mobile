# 10.1 Wrapping Callbacks Without Cancellation Support (INTEROP_001)

## Bad Practice

Using `suspendCoroutine` to wrap async callbacks. When the parent coroutine is cancelled the callback remains registered, leaking memory and resuming a dead continuation. The callback may call `resume` on a continuation that was already discarded, causing undefined behavior.

```kotlin
// [INTEROP_001] suspendCoroutine does not support cancellation
suspend fun fetchUser(id: String): User = suspendCoroutine { cont ->
    api.getUser(id,
        onSuccess = { cont.resume(it) },
        onError = { cont.resumeWithException(it) }
    )
    // if parent cancels, the listener stays active
}
```

## Recommended

Use `suspendCancellableCoroutine` and register cleanup in `invokeOnCancellation`. This ensures that when the parent coroutine cancels, the callback is unregistered and resources are released properly.

```kotlin
// suspendCancellableCoroutine + invokeOnCancellation for proper cleanup
suspend fun fetchUser(id: String): User = suspendCancellableCoroutine { cont ->
    val call = api.getUser(id,
        onSuccess = { cont.resume(it) },
        onError = { cont.resumeWithException(it) }
    )
    cont.invokeOnCancellation { call.cancel() }
}
```

## Why

Cancellation must be wired for callback APIs. Without `invokeOnCancellation`, cancelled
coroutines leave zombie callbacks that violate structured concurrency.

## Quick fix

| Erroneous | Optimized |
|-----------|-----------|
| `suspend fun fetchUser(id: String): User = suspendCoroutine { cont ->` | `suspend fun fetchUser(id: String): User = suspendCancellableCoroutine { cont ->` |
