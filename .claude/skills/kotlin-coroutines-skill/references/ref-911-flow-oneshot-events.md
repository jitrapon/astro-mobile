# 9.11 SharedFlow For One-Shot Events (FLOW_011)

## Bad Practice

Default `MutableSharedFlow` (replay=0) for navigation/snackbar events — events can be lost before collector attaches.

```kotlin
// BAD: SharedFlow with replay=0 can drop one-shot events
private val _events = MutableSharedFlow<NavigationEvent>()
val events = _events.asSharedFlow()
```

## Recommended

`Channel(BUFFERED).receiveAsFlow()` or SharedFlow with explicit replay/buffer for your delivery semantics.

```kotlin
// GOOD: Channel buffers one-shot events until collected
private val _events = Channel<NavigationEvent>(Channel.BUFFERED)
val events = _events.receiveAsFlow()
```

## Why

Default `SharedFlow` does not buffer for late subscribers. One-shot events need a
channel or explicit replay/buffer policy.

## Quick fix

| Erroneous | Optimized |
|-----------|-----------|
| `private val _events = MutableSharedFlow<NavigationEvent>()` | `private val _events = Channel<NavigationEvent>(Channel.BUFFERED)` |
