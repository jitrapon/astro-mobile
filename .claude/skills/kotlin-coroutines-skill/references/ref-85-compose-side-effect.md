# 8.5 Side Effect In Composable Body (COMPOSE_003)

## Bad Practice

Analytics, logging, or state mutation called directly in the Composable body (runs every recomposition).

```kotlin
// BAD: analytics on every recomposition
@Composable
fun HomeScreen() {
    analytics.logScreen("home")
    Text("Welcome")
}
```

## Recommended

Move side effects to `SideEffect`, `LaunchedEffect`, or `DisposableEffect`, or event handlers.

```kotlin
// GOOD: scoped side effect
@Composable
fun HomeScreen() {
    SideEffect { analytics.logScreen("home") }
    Text("Welcome")
}
```

## Why

Recomposition can happen frequently. Unscoped side effects in the body multiply
executions and break predictability.

## Quick fix
