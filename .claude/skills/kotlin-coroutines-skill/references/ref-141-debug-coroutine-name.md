# 14.1 Missing CoroutineName (DEBUG_001)

## Bad Practice

`launch` / `async` without `CoroutineName` in context — hard to debug in logs and Coroutines Debugger.

```kotlin
// BAD: anonymous coroutine — hard to debug
scope.launch { syncOrders() }
```

## Recommended

`launch(CoroutineName("load-user-${id}")) { }` for non-trivial work (opt-in Detekt rule).

```kotlin
// GOOD: named for logs and debugger
scope.launch(CoroutineName("sync-orders")) { syncOrders() }
```

## Why

Named coroutines appear in debugging tools and structured logs, shortening time to find
which job failed or is still running.

## Quick fix

| Erroneous | Optimized |
|-----------|-----------|
| `scope.launch { syncOrders() }` | `scope.launch(CoroutineName("sync-orders")) { syncOrders() }` |
