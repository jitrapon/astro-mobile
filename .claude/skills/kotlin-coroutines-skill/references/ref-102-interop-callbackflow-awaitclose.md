# 10.2 callbackFlow Without awaitClose (INTEROP_002)

## Bad Practice

Using `callbackFlow { }` without `awaitClose { }`. Starting from kotlinx-coroutines 1.6, a `callbackFlow` without `awaitClose` throws `IllegalStateException` at runtime when the flow is cancelled. Additionally, registered listeners are never unregistered, causing memory leaks.

```kotlin
// [INTEROP_002] callbackFlow without awaitClose — IllegalStateException + listener leak
fun locationFlow(): Flow<Location> = callbackFlow {
    val cb = LocationCallback { trySend(it) }
    manager.register(cb)
    // Missing awaitClose!
}
```

## Recommended

Always include `awaitClose { /* unregister listener */ }` at the end of every `callbackFlow` block. `awaitClose` suspends until the collector cancels or completes, giving you the lifecycle hook to clean up. Note: this rule does NOT apply to `channelFlow`.

```kotlin
// callbackFlow with awaitClose ensures listener cleanup
fun locationFlow(): Flow<Location> = callbackFlow {
    val cb = LocationCallback { trySend(it) }
    manager.register(cb)
    awaitClose { manager.unregister(cb) }
}
```

## Why

`awaitClose` suspends until the collector completes or cancels, giving the hook to tear
down platform callbacks. Without it, flows leak and may throw at runtime.
