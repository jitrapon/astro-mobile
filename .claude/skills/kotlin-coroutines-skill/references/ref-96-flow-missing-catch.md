# 9.6 Missing catch in Flow Chain (FLOW_005)

## Bad Practice

A `.collect {}` or `.launchIn(scope)` call on a Flow chain with intermediate operators but no `.catch {}`. Exceptions from any upstream operator propagate to the parent scope and cancel it, causing silent crashes in production that are difficult to trace.

```kotlin
// [FLOW_005] Uncaught exception cancels viewModelScope
repository.getItems()
    .map { it.toUiModel() }
    .collect { _state.value = it }
```

## Recommended

Add `.catch { e -> }` before the terminal operator to handle errors locally. Avoid wrapping the entire chain in a generic `try/catch` — it does not compose well with Flow cancellation semantics. Exclude test source roots where propagation to the test scope is intentional.

```kotlin
// catch before collect
repository.getItems()
    .map { it.toUiModel() }
    .catch { e -> _error.value = e.message }
    .collect { _state.value = it }
```

## Why

Flow operators run in the collecting coroutine's context. An uncaught exception upstream
cancels `viewModelScope` or `lifecycleScope`, often as a silent production crash.

## Quick fix

| Erroneous | Optimized |
|-----------|-----------|
| `repository.getItems()` | `repository.getItems()` |
