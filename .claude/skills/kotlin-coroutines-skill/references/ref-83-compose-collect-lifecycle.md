# 8.3 collectAsState Without Lifecycle Awareness (COMPOSE_001)

## Bad Practice

Using `Flow.collectAsState()` (or `StateFlow.collectAsState()`) in a `@Composable` on Android. Collection continues while the composition is inactive (screen off, app in background), wasting work and updating UI that is not visible.

```kotlin
// [COMPOSE_001] Collects while lifecycle is STOPPED
@Composable
fun HomeScreen(viewModel: HomeViewModel) {
    val state by viewModel.uiState.collectAsState()
}
```

## Recommended

On Android screens, use `collectAsStateWithLifecycle()` from `androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-runtime-compose`. Add the dependency first. `@Preview` composables and non-Android Compose targets may keep `collectAsState()` when intentional.

```kotlin
// Lifecycle-aware collection (Android)
@Composable
fun HomeScreen(viewModel: HomeViewModel) {
    val state by viewModel.uiState.collectAsStateWithLifecycle()
}
```

## Why

Compose composition can outlive visible lifecycle states. Without lifecycle-aware
collection, ViewModel flows keep collecting and recomposing off-screen UI.

## Quick fix

| Erroneous | Optimized |
|-----------|-----------|
| `viewModel.uiState.collectAsState()` in Android screen | `viewModel.uiState.collectAsStateWithLifecycle()` |
